# Structural Gravity Model Estimation Using India-ASEAN Trade Data

This repository analyzes the ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA) using a structural gravity model. The study examines the impact of AIFTA on India's trade with ASEAN countries and other global partners.

## Objectives

1. **Estimate Structural Gravity Model**  
   Analyze trade data between India and ASEAN countries using the Anderson and Wincoop (2003) model. Key factors include GDP, geographical distance, and trade costs.

2. **Counterfactual Analysis**  
   Simulate various scenarios using the `gegravity` Python package to explore potential policy impacts on trade dynamics and regional integration.

## Methodology

- **Data**: Covers 27 countries (10 ASEAN members, India, and 16 others), resulting in 729 observations.
- **Model**: Accounts for trade and transportation costs. 

## Tools

- **`gegravity` Python Package**: For estimating general equilibrium models and running counterfactual simulations.

## Insights

Provides insights into the economic impact of AIFTA and potential effects of deeper integration on trade relations.
